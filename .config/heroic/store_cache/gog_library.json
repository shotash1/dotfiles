Explore the eponymous land of Nehrim and its dense forests and deserts, delve into ancient crypts and labyrinthine caves, and experience an unconventional, gripping storyline that unfolds beyond known patterns of good and evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://items.gog.com/nehrim_at_fates_edge/NehrimMap.png\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>How extensive is the world space and how has it been created?</b><br>\r\nThe land mass approximately equals the one of Oblivion. However, in Nehrim the landscape is entirely hand-built and thus has a lot more variety in it than those forests in Oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>How long will it take me to beat the game?</b><br>\r\nAs opposed to Oblivion, the Main Quest, including 35 single quests, is to the fore in Nehrim. Our Main Quest isn't just much more intense than Oblivion's, but also more extensive. You can beat Oblivion in about 10 hours. This most definitely will not be possible in Nehrim. Additionally, there will be about 30 side quests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What is the most profound difference to Oblivion?</b><br>\r\nThe skill system. In Nehrim, you level up by gaining experience points. You gain experience points by killing monsters and most of all for finishing quests. This is the best way to motivate the player to play them. At each level-up you get \"learning points\" you can trade for skill upgrades at a teacher - just as in the Gothic series.",

					"description": "Set 50 years after the climactic events of the original Red Faction, Red Faction: Guerrilla allows players to take the role of an insurgent fighter with the newly re-established Red Faction movement as they battle for liberation from the oppressive Earth Defense Force. Red Faction: Guerrilla re-defines the limits of destruction-based game-play with a huge open-world, fast-paced guerrilla-style combat, and true physics-based destruction. \n \nKey Features \n \nOpen World Guerrilla Warfare - You decide who, when, where and how to battle. Utilize guerrilla tactics, improvised weaponry, and modified vehicles to lead insurgent attacks on EDF targets. Launch attacks based on your own gameplay style, take on missions in any order you choose, or engage in destructive activities to weaken the EDF's grip on Mars. \n \nStrategic Destruction - Use destruction to your tactical advantage, setting ambushes or chain reaction explosions to attack enemy strongholds and permanently modify the game environment. Leverage fully-dynamic physics-based destruction to improvise on the fly: blow holes in a wall or floor to set an ambush or escape, take out a staircase to stop your pursuers, or drive vehicles through blown out walls. \n \nEvolving & Emergent Gameplay - Carve your path through an ever changing landscape as you improvise your combat tactics - mixing gameplay styles, vehicles, weapons and explosives to defeat the EDF. \n \nEpic Sci-Fi Setting - Explore the huge, unforgiving Martian landscape, from the desolate mining outpost of Parker to the gleaming EDF capital city of Eos; then tear through the fully destructible open-world environments swarming with EDF forces, Red Faction resistance fighters, and the downtrodden settlers caught in the cross-fire. \n \nMultiplayer Combat - There is no place to hide when you put your guerrilla warfare skills to the test in a variety of highly destructive multiplayer combat modes. \n \nRe-Mars-tered Features \n \nFully reworked graphics – Heavily reworked textures and graphic features adding for example specular maps. \n \nImproved shadow rendering \n \nImproved Lighting \n \nShader & Postprocessing rework \n \nNative 4k support for the finest up to date mars destruction experience ever",
